# Brushless Motor Controller V2 Firmware

This repository contains firmware and a UI for interacting with the [DogBot] robotic hardware platform developed by [React AI]

Note: this code is still work-in-progress.

Corresponding higher-level ROS control software, along with CAD packages and other artifacts, can be found in the [Dogbot repo].  While that code requires the firmware to operate, the code in this repository is self-contained.

# Installation

## Pre-requisites
[Qt] is required to build and run the UI, it was built and tested with Qt version 5.9.2 64-bit.

The software was developed and has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04

## Setup steps
To use USB you need access to the appropriate device:

```bat
sudo cp ./API/src/reactai.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
```
There is a [configuration file](./Config/configexample.json): to enable the ROS components in the [Dogbot repo] to access this it should be copied into ~/.config/DogBot

The code under [API](./API) should be built with `cmake --build` and `make install`. There is a script to wrap these steps at [buildall.sh](./Scripts/buildall.sh)

There is an installation script at [setup.sh](./Scripts/setup.sh), calling it as `setup.sh 1` also calls the build script.

# Operation

Please refer to the product user-guide for warnings and safety considerations.

## Switch On

Use a benchtop power supply of between 14V and 30V

* Check cables are red-red throughout; check for loose wires, obstructions
* Connect power supply
* Switch on power supply.  Green light on each PCB should flash (and a steady red light in the middle, inside the housing)
* Connect the PCB via a USB cable to your computer

## Connecting to the Controllers

The UI can make a direct USB connection, or connect to a local instance of 'dogBotServer'.  The latter is recommended, as it allows for multiple local clients, e.g. multiple UIs, or UI plus a ROS client.

run the local server:
```bat
cd API/build/src
./dogBotServer
```
When you build and run the client in Qt, it will open to a connection screen:

* open Qt Creator
* open and run GUI/DogBotUI.pro
* pick 'local' as the connection type
* click 'Connect'

On the Overview tab you should then see a summary row for each detected motor.

## Homing and Moving

To operate the motors via ROS, they must be homed, i.e. made aware of their absolute position.   This requires them to move past their end-stops, which are detected magnetically.

The 'Homed' column on the UI overview tab will probably say 'Measuring' in their pre-homed start-up state.

Homing the motors, method 1:
* turn all motors off on the Overview tab
* manually move joints past two sensor stops
* homing status of each should change to Homed

Method 2:
* note the ID for the required joint on the Overview tab
* move to the Motor Setup tab, pictured below, and select the motor by its ID
* Set the Dynamic Mode to Relative
* set the current limit to around 2.5A
* carefully move the motor by using the Position slider, backwards and forwards until it reaches its end-stop points.  The Homing status should change to Homed.

**If the motor oscillates** there is insufficient current for the control loop to complete, and you must increase the current limit.

If a motor displays a fault (also indicated by a flashing amber light on the PCB), you may be able to clear it by changing the controller State to Reset in the Motor Setup tab.

The motor(s) may now be controlled via ROS if you wish, further details for that are in the [Dogbot repo]
